# /git-pr-merge

A guided multi-step git workflow that takes a feature branch from "uncommitted work" all the way through PR merge and worktree cleanup, with build validation gates on either side of the merge. Designed to be run by Claude Code in concert with the user's explicit step-chain approval.

## When to use it

- You're on a feature branch in a worktree, work is finished, and you want one chain that commits → PRs → merges → cleans up.
- You want hard build-validation gates around the merge so a broken main is caught immediately.
- You want the workflow to halt and surface anomalies (dirty worktree, build failures, unrelated errors) instead of silently continuing.

Do **not** use this skill for partial flows (e.g. just commit, just push). Use `/git-checkin` for those.

## Governance — read before running

This skill operates under the user's CRITICAL governance rules from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

1. **Data Protection (HIGHEST PRIORITY).** No destructive operation runs without an explicit, named approval. Branch deletion, worktree removal, and force-deletes are all destructive and are gated.
2. **No Commits or Deployments Without Approval (HIGHEST PRIORITY).** `git commit`, `git push`, `gh pr create`, and `gh pr merge` all require approval before execution.
3. **Multi-Step Workflow Approvals exception.** When the user explicitly enumerates the chain ("commit, push, open PR, merge, refresh, clean") that single approval covers every named step. Steps **not** named are still gated separately.
4. **Stop and surface, do not skip.** A failed conditional step (build red, push rejected, merge conflict, unexpected file) halts the chain and reports back. The skill never silently retries or works around an anomaly.
5. **Treat the unexpected as a halt.** Untracked files you didn't create, an already-dirty parent worktree, a remote ahead of local, an unrelated test failure — all halt the chain pending user direction.

## Workflow steps

The chain runs strictly in order. Any failure stops the chain.

### Pre-flight

- `git status` — confirm working tree state. Anything unexpected (files the user didn't ask you to touch) halts.
- `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` — confirm current branch is **not** `main` / `master`. If it is, halt.
- `git remote -v` — confirm a remote (`origin`) is configured. If not, halt.
- Capture the current worktree path (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) — this is the **feature worktree** that will be removed at the end.
- Resolve the **main worktree** (`git worktree list --porcelain`, find the entry whose branch is `refs/heads/main`). Capture its path — this is where build-validation #2 and worktree cleanup run.

### Commit

1. Stage explicit files by name (never `git add .` or `git add -A` blindly — see governance rule #1).
2. Draft a Conventional Commits message (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`).
3. Print the message and the staged file list to the user.
4. On approval, `git commit` with the heredoc form so multi-line messages survive shell quoting:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <subject>

   <body>

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

### Push & PR

1. `git push -u origin <branch>`. If the remote rejects (non-fast-forward, protected branch, auth failure), halt.
2. `gh pr create --title "<subject>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"`. The body must follow this template:
   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   <1-3 bullet points covering the why>

   ## Test plan
   - [ ] <what was checked>
   - [ ] <build / lint / smoketest results>
   ```
3. Capture the PR number from the `gh` output for the merge step.

### Build validation #1 (feature worktree)

- Run `npm run build` (or the project's documented build command) **from the feature worktree**.
- On failure: **STOP**. Report the failing output verbatim. Do not merge. Do not retry. Do not proceed to cleanup.
- On success: continue.

### Squash-merge

1. `gh pr merge <num> --squash --delete-branch`.
2. If `--delete-branch` fails because the branch is checked out in another worktree (this is the common case — the feature worktree still has it), fall back to:
   ```bash
   gh api -X DELETE repos/:owner/:repo/git/refs/heads/<branch>
   ```
   This deletes the remote ref directly, bypassing the local-checkout safety check.
3. If the merge itself fails (conflicts, required reviews, failing checks), halt and report.

### Refresh main worktree

- `cd <main-worktree-path> && git pull --ff-only origin main`.
- If `--ff-only` fails (the main worktree has diverging local commits), halt — the user needs to resolve.

### Build validation #2 (main worktree)

- From the main worktree path, run the project's build command again.
- **Critical halt rule.** If this build fails on something that is clearly **unrelated** to the merged PR (e.g. a TypeScript error in a file the PR didn't touch, a test that was already broken, a missing dependency unrelated to the change), **STOP**. Do **not** proceed to worktree cleanup. Report the failure to the user verbatim and let them decide. The feature worktree must remain intact in case rollback is needed.
- If the build passes, continue to cleanup.

### Worktree cleanup

1. From the main worktree (never from inside the feature worktree), run:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove <feature-worktree-path>
   ```
2. If the remove fails because of build artifacts or untracked files inside the feature worktree, retry with `--force`:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove --force <feature-worktree-path>
   ```
   `--force` is safe here only because the work has already been merged to `origin/main` and the local main worktree is up to date — both invariants were verified in the steps above.
3. Detach & delete the local feature branch (it may still exist locally even after `--delete-branch` on the PR):
   ```bash
   git branch -D <branch>
   ```
   Use `-D` (force) because the branch was squash-merged — `-d` would refuse it as "not merged" since squash creates a new commit hash.

## Approval pattern

The skill expects to be invoked in one of two ways:

**Single chained approval (preferred).** The user says something like:
> "Commit these changes, push the branch, open a PR titled 'fix: timer offset', squash-merge it, refresh main, and clean up the worktree."

That single sentence enumerates every step and counts as approval for the whole chain (per governance rule #3). The skill executes top to bottom and only halts on failure.

**Step-by-step.** The user invokes `/git-pr-merge --interactive` (or omits a chained instruction). The skill prompts for approval at each commit/push/merge/cleanup boundary.

## Halt conditions (non-exhaustive)

The skill stops and surfaces — never silently continues — when any of the following occur:

- Pre-flight: dirty unrelated files, already on main, no remote, missing main worktree.
- Commit: empty message, staged-files list doesn't match what the user described.
- Push: rejected by remote, branch protection violation, auth failure.
- PR: `gh` not installed or not authenticated, body template incomplete.
- Build #1: any non-zero exit from the build command.
- Merge: conflicts, required reviews not met, required checks failing.
- Refresh: non-fast-forward `git pull` on main worktree.
- Build #2: any non-zero exit, regardless of whether the cause appears related to the PR.
- Cleanup: `git worktree remove` failing for a reason other than build artifacts.

In every halt case the skill prints what happened, what state the repo is in, and what the user can do next. It does not roll back automatically.

## Usage

```bash
/git-pr-merge                                  # Run with chained approval (read from prior message)
/git-pr-merge --interactive                    # Prompt at each gate
/git-pr-merge --dry-run                        # Print every command without executing
/git-pr-merge --pr-title "fix: timer offset"   # Pre-supply the PR title
/git-pr-merge --skip-build-1                   # Skip pre-merge build (NOT RECOMMENDED)
/git-pr-merge --skip-build-2                   # Skip post-merge build (NOT RECOMMENDED)
/git-pr-merge --help
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--interactive` | Prompt for approval at each gate (commit, push, PR, merge, cleanup). Default if no chained approval is detected. |
| `--dry-run` | Print every command that would run without executing. No git/gh state changes. |
| `--pr-title <s>` | Pre-supply the PR title. Otherwise derived from the commit subject. |
| `--pr-body <s>` | Pre-supply the PR body (must already follow the Summary / Test plan template). |
| `--build-cmd <s>` | Override the build command. Default: `npm run build`. |
| `--skip-build-1` | Skip pre-merge build validation. **Not recommended** — it's the cheaper of the two halt gates. |
| `--skip-build-2` | Skip post-merge build validation. **Not recommended** — this is the gate that catches a broken main. |
| `-f`, `--force` | Skip non-destructive confirmations (does **not** bypass governance gates). |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help. |

## Requirements

- Git 2.30+ (for modern `git worktree` semantics)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- A configured `origin` remote on GitHub
- Node.js 18+ (for the build command, if `npm run build` is used)
- The project must have a buildable command for the two validation gates
