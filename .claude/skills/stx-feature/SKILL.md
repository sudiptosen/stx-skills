description: Drives a multi-agent feature implementation wave. Interviews the user, runs Analyst → Architect → QA in sequence (each behind a gate), then schedules tier-specialized Dev agents under a Reviewer + QA control loop. Produces requirement-verse.html, architecture-verse.html, qa-verse.html, and result.html artifacts in docs/waves/. Use when a new feature (multi-task, possibly multi-tier) needs to be implemented, not a single bug fix.

# /stx-feature

A guided multi-agent feature-implementation workflow. The skill interviews the user about a desired feature, runs three specialist agents (Analyst, Architect, QA) sequentially — each behind a user-approval gate — and then dispatches one or more tier-specialized Dev agents in a QA-controlled loop until every task in every feature is green.

This skill is a **sibling** to `/stx-fix`, not a replacement. `/stx-fix` handles a single reproducible bug with two agents (QA + Coder); `/stx-feature` handles new functionality that decomposes into multiple features and tasks across tiers (database / service / API / UI).

## Personas (loaded by reference)

Every agent contract lives in its own file under `.claude/agents/`. The skill loads them at spawn time — it never embeds them inline. See [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) at the repo root for the full inventory.

| Persona file | Role | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/agents/stx-analyst.md` | Analyst | Step 2 |
| `.claude/agents/stx-architect.md` | Architect | Step 3 (and Step 6 on escalation) |
| `.claude/agents/stx-qa.md` | QA | Step 4 + Step 6 (test rerun after Reviewer approves) |
| `.claude/agents/stx-reviewer.md` | Reviewer (new in v1.2) | Step 6, between Dev hand-back and QA rerun |
| `.claude/agents/stx-dev-base.md` | Dev (universal prelude) | Step 5 (every Dev) |
| `.claude/agents/stx-dev-tier-db.md` | Dev (db tier) | Step 5 when `task.tier == "db"` |
| `.claude/agents/stx-dev-tier-service.md` | Dev (service tier) | Step 5 when `task.tier == "service"` |
| `.claude/agents/stx-dev-tier-api.md` | Dev (api tier) | Step 5 when `task.tier == "api"` |
| `.claude/agents/stx-dev-tier-ui.md` | Dev (ui tier) | Step 5 when `task.tier == "ui"` |

When spawning each agent, paste the contents of the matching persona file into the agent's prompt verbatim, then prepend any task-specific context (task spec, file paths, prior verdicts). The orchestrator does NOT re-implement persona logic.

## When to use it

- A new feature (or small cluster of related features) needs to be implemented.
- The work spans more than one architectural tier, or has more than one acceptance test, or both.
- The user wants **failing tests written first**, **a written architecture decision**, and **suspicious-change tracking** — not freeform "go build it."

Do **not** use this skill for:
- Single-bug fixes — use `/stx-fix` instead.
- Refactors with no behavior change — there's no failing test to anchor to.
- Vague aspirations without acceptance criteria — interview the user to a concrete feature list first.

## Governance — read before running

This skill operates under the user's CRITICAL governance rules from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

1. **Always Work In A Worktree (HIGHEST PRIORITY).** The skill MUST confirm the user is on a non-`main` worktree before any agent runs. If the user is on `main` / `master`, the skill **stops and proposes** a new worktree before continuing.
2. **No Commits or Deployments Without Approval.** Any commit, push, or PR step at the end of the wave is gated on explicit user approval.
3. **Data Protection.** No destructive operation (no test deletion, no force-pushes, no branch removal) without an explicit named approval. This is especially important when the *feature itself* is destructive (e.g. multi-delete) — Dev agents MUST add environment guards and never run delete-style tests against production data.
4. **QA / Dev separation (per user's auto-memory `feedback_qa_fixer_workflow.md`).** Dev agents MUST NOT edit the QA agent's test files. Touching a test file is a halt-the-loop offense.

## Concepts

- **Wave** — a single invocation of `/stx-feature`. One wave produces one worktree, one branch, one PR, and a directory `docs/waves/wave-{slug}-{4-char-random}/`.
- **Feature** — a kanban card. Lives in `requirement-verse.html`. Has acceptance criteria.
- **Task** — a unit of implementation work under a Feature. Lives in `architecture-verse.html`. Each task is tagged with a `tier` (db / service / api / ui) and `scope_paths` (the files it may touch). One QA test maps to each task.
- **Gate** — a hard pause where the user must approve an artifact (HTML) before the next phase runs.
- **Tier-specialized Dev agent** — a Dev agent spawned with `stx-dev-base.md` plus the matching `stx-dev-tier-*.md` persona overlay, determined by the task's `tier` field.

## Artifacts (written into the consuming project)

Everything lives under `docs/waves/wave-{slug}-{xxx}/` in the consuming repo:

| File | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `wave-state.json` | Skill orchestrator | Source of truth: features, tasks, statuses, iteration counters, `suspicious[]`, `escalations[]`, `persona_versions` |
| `requirement-verse.html` | Analyst | Rendered Features list with acceptance criteria |
| `architecture-verse.html` | Architect | Rendered Tasks per Feature with tier + scope_paths + revisions on escalation |
| `qa-verse.html` | QA Agent | Rendered list of failing tests, mapped task → test file |
| `result.html` | Skill orchestrator | End-of-wave summary including suspicious changes |
| `handoff.md` | Skill orchestrator | Only written when an iteration cap trips or the wave is halted |

HTML is rendered from `wave-state.json` after every state change — JSON is canonical, HTML is presentation. Templates ship with the skill (see `templates/` directory).

## Workflow

Strict ordering. Three approval gates. The skill never starts a phase without the previous phase's gate being explicitly approved.

### Step 0 — Confirm worktree state

Before any other question:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git worktree list --porcelain
```

- **On a feature branch in a non-main worktree:** confirm one-line ("We're on `<branch>` at `<path>` — work here?"). If yes, continue.
- **On `main` / `master`:** STOP. Use `AskUserQuestion` to propose a worktree name derived from the user's initial feature description. Do NOT proceed until a worktree exists.

Worktree command pattern:

```bash
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/wave-<slug> -b feat/wave-<slug>
ln -sf <main-repo>/.env.local .claude/worktrees/wave-<slug>/.env.local  # if applicable
```

### Step 1 — Capture initial feature description

The user MAY invoke the skill with a feature description, e.g.:

```
/stx-feature Admin multi-delete on /dashboard
```

If so, take the argument as `initial_request`. Otherwise, ask the user one open question: *"In a few sentences, describe the feature you want implemented."* The result populates `initial_request` in `wave-state.json`.

This is the **seed** for everything downstream. Subsequent agents add clarity; they do not replace it.

Also at this step: record the persona versions that will drive the wave. Read the YAML frontmatter of every persona file under `.claude/agents/` and write a `persona_versions` block to `wave-state.json`:

```json
"persona_versions": {
  "analyst": "1.0.0",
  "architect": "1.0.0",
  "qa": "1.0.0",
  "reviewer": "1.0.0",
  "dev_base": "1.0.0",
  "dev_tier_db": "1.0.0",
  "dev_tier_service": "1.0.0",
  "dev_tier_api": "1.0.0",
  "dev_tier_ui": "1.0.0"
}
```

This locks the wave to a specific persona snapshot — essential for future cross-wave metrics aggregation.

### Step 2 — Analyst (Agent 1)

**Spawn:** `Agent` with `subagent_type: general-purpose` (or `Explore` for read-only research first if scoping is unclear). Paste the contents of `.claude/agents/stx-analyst.md` into the agent's prompt verbatim, then append:

> The current wave-state is at `<path-to-wave-state.json>`. The initial request is: `<initial_request>`. The bundled template for requirement-verse.html is at `<path-to-templates/requirement-verse.html>`.

The Analyst follows the contract in its persona file. Do not embed contract logic here.

★ **Gate 1: user approves `requirement-verse.html`.** Use `AskUserQuestion` with three options: *Approve*, *Edit a feature*, *Cancel wave*. Do not proceed without explicit approval.

### Step 3 — Architect (Agent 2)

**Spawn:** `Agent` with `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Paste the contents of `.claude/agents/stx-architect.md` into the agent's prompt verbatim, then append:

> The approved requirement-verse.html is at `<path>`. The current wave-state is at `<path>`. The bundled template for architecture-verse.html is at `<path>`.

The Architect follows the contract in its persona file.

★ **Gate 2: user approves `architecture-verse.html`.** Scope is now FROZEN — anything not listed in tasks or marked in scope_paths is off-limits for the wave.

### Step 4 — QA Agent (Agent 3)

**Spawn:** `Agent` with `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Paste the contents of `.claude/agents/stx-qa.md` into the agent's prompt verbatim, then append:

> The approved requirement-verse.html and architecture-verse.html are at `<paths>`. The current wave-state is at `<path>`. The bundled template for qa-verse.html is at `<path>`.

The QA agent follows the **authoring contract** section of its persona file.

★ **Gate 3 (Dry-run boundary): user approves `qa-verse.html` AND the failing tests.** This is the most expensive gate to fail past — failing tests that encode the wrong acceptance criteria poison the rest of the wave.

By default, the skill **stops here** unless the user explicitly chose to continue past dry-run in the interview.

### Step 5 — Dev wave (Agents 4..n)

After gate 3 approval, the orchestrator schedules Dev agents.

**Scheduling rules:**
- A task is **eligible** when all its `depends_on` tasks are `done`.
- Two eligible tasks may run **in parallel** only if their `scope_paths` arrays have **no overlap** (no shared files, no shared globs).
- Concurrency cap: 3 parallel Dev agents by default (user-configurable in interview).

**Persona dispatch.** Each Dev agent is spawned with a tier-specialized prompt assembled from two persona files:

| `task.tier` | Persona files to concatenate (base first, then tier overlay) |
|---|---|
| `db` | `.claude/agents/stx-dev-base.md` + `.claude/agents/stx-dev-tier-db.md` |
| `service` | `.claude/agents/stx-dev-base.md` + `.claude/agents/stx-dev-tier-service.md` |
| `api` | `.claude/agents/stx-dev-base.md` + `.claude/agents/stx-dev-tier-api.md` |
| `ui` | `.claude/agents/stx-dev-base.md` + `.claude/agents/stx-dev-tier-ui.md` |

After concatenating the two persona files, append the task-specific context:

> Your task is `<task.id> — <task.title>`. The failing test is at `<task.test_path>`. `scope_paths`: `<task.scope_paths>`. `existing_patterns_to_follow`: `<task.existing_patterns_to_follow>`. The architecture-verse.html with the frozen out-of-scope list is at `<path>`.

The Dev follows the contract in its persona files. Do not re-explain Dev rules here — the persona files are the source of truth.

### Step 6 — Dev ↔ Reviewer ↔ QA loop

Per task:

```
QA confirms test fails for the right reason
   ↓
Dev (tier-specialized) implements
   ↓
Dev runs test + lint + build, hands back diff
   ↓
Reviewer reads diff vs task spec  ← .claude/agents/stx-reviewer.md
   ├─ approved=true       → hand off to QA
   ├─ approved=false      → bounce to Dev with concerns[] (iteration++)
   └─ halt verdict        → STOP wave for this task (test-file edit / SUT mock / assertion weakened)
   ↓
QA reruns test independently      ← .claude/agents/stx-qa.md verification contract
   ├─ green → mark task done
   └─ red   → return to Dev with specific failure (iteration++)
```

**Why the Reviewer sits between Dev and QA.** Without a Reviewer, QA's rerun is the only signal between "Dev says done" and "task closed." A Dev that mocks the system-under-test or weakens the assertion can drive QA green and bypass the test the bug was written to catch. The Reviewer is the integrity gate: it reads the diff, line-by-line, before QA touches it. Its verdict is appended to `wave-state.json.reviewer_verdicts[]` per iteration.

**Spawning the Reviewer.** After every Dev hand-back, spawn the Reviewer via `Agent` with `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Paste the contents of `.claude/agents/stx-reviewer.md` verbatim, then append:

> The Dev's diff (full output of `git diff` since the last accepted state) is below. The task spec is at `<path-to-architecture-verse.html>`, task id `<task.id>`. The failing test file is at `<task.test_path>`. Prior reviewer_verdicts[] for this task: `<json>`. Apply your checklist and emit your verdict per the persona contract.

**Caps:**
- **Soft cap — 3 iterations on the same task:** halt this task, escalate to Architect. An iteration is incremented by **either** a Reviewer rejection **or** a QA red — both count. Re-spawn the Architect with its persona file plus the task context + the latest reviewer verdict. Architect may amend `architecture-verse.html` (append a "Revision N" section — never overwrite), then the loop resumes.
- **Hard cap — 5 total iterations on the same task:** halt the wave for this task. Write `handoff.md` and surface to user.
- **Reviewer halt verdict — instant wave halt for this task:** `test-file-edit-detected`, `assertion-weakened`, or `sut-mocked` short-circuits the loop without incrementing counters. The user decides whether to escalate to Architect or close out the wave.

QA's pause authority (build breaks twice, scope violation, test-bypass detection caught at rerun time) is defined in `.claude/agents/stx-qa.md` under **Pause authority**. Reviewer halts and QA pauses are independent — a Dev can be halted by either.

### Step 7 — Feature done / Wave done

- **Feature done** = all its tasks are `done` (QA-confirmed green) AND no open `suspicious[]` items targeting that feature.
- **Wave done** = all features done.

### Step 8 — Render `result.html` and report

Final orchestrator step:

1. Update `wave-state.json` with final status.
2. Render `result.html` from the bundled template, including:
   - Per-feature, per-task status table
   - Iteration counts per task (broken down: Reviewer rejections vs QA reds)
   - `reviewer_verdicts[]` array per task (the full verdict trail with concerns/suggestions)
   - `suspicious[]` array fully rendered (one row per event)
   - `escalations[]` (when Architect was re-engaged)
   - `persona_versions` (the locked snapshot from Step 1)
   - Files touched (deduplicated)
   - Total agents spawned and total run time (now includes reviewer count)
3. Surface to user with a one-paragraph summary and next-action prompt (commit? PR?).

## Iteration caps (summary)

- **Soft cap — 3 same-task iterations:** halt task, escalate to Architect, append Revision section. An iteration = one Reviewer rejection OR one QA red.
- **Hard cap — 5 same-task iterations:** halt wave, write `handoff.md`.
- **Suspicious-changes ceiling — 3 events on the same task:** auto-halt the task even if not at iteration cap.
- **Reviewer halt verdicts (instant):** `test-file-edit-detected`, `assertion-weakened`, `sut-mocked` — no counter increment, immediate halt.

These reconcile the user's auto-memory `feedback_qa_fixer_workflow.md` (≤3 same-topic) with the longer-running nature of feature work (multi-task loop).

## Halt conditions

The skill stops and surfaces — never silently continues — when:

- Worktree state cannot be confirmed (detached HEAD, no git, etc.).
- A persona file under `.claude/agents/` cannot be read at spawn time (treat as a fatal config error — do not fall back to inline prompts).
- The user declines any of the three gates.
- The Analyst cannot extract features from the initial_request (vague request — surfaces a clarifying interview round).
- The Architect cannot tier a task (`tier == "unknown"` → halt, ask user).
- The QA agent cannot write a test for a task (timing-sensitive, infra-dependent) — QA documents *why* and proposes manual verification; orchestrator surfaces this rather than silently skipping.
- A Dev agent edits a test file or touches files outside `scope_paths`.
- The Reviewer returns a halt verdict (`test-file-edit-detected`, `assertion-weakened`, `sut-mocked`) — instant halt for the task, no iteration counter increment.
- An iteration cap or suspicious-changes ceiling trips.
- `npm run lint` or `npm run build` fails for a reason unrelated to the task.
- Out-of-scope guardrails (from `requirement-verse.html` or `architecture-verse.html`) are violated.

## Usage

```
/stx-feature                                    # Fully interactive
/stx-feature <one-line feature description>     # Seed initial_request, then interactive
```

This skill does not have a CLI binary — it is purely conversational and runs inside the assistant. The skill writes to disk: `docs/waves/wave-<slug>-<xxxx>/` in the consuming project.

## Requirements

- Git 2.30+ for modern `git worktree` semantics.
- Node.js 18+ for `npm run lint` / `npm run build`.
- A buildable command and at least one test runner in the consuming project (Playwright, Vitest, or both). Vitest is scaffolded only with user approval.
- For browser verification: Chrome DevTools or Playwright MCP server registered in the session.
- The eight persona files at `.claude/agents/stx-{analyst,architect,qa,dev-base,dev-tier-db,dev-tier-service,dev-tier-api,dev-tier-ui}.md`. The installer copies these alongside `.claude/skills/`.
