  FIX-ISSUE PROMPT TEMPLATE (embedded in /stx-fix skill)

  The /stx-fix skill (see SKILL.md in this directory) interviews the user
  to fill the FORM_FIELDS below, then renders this file with placeholders
  substituted and conditional blocks resolved.

  This file can ALSO be consumed by the Chrome-extension renderer used by
  multi-feat-multi-agent.md — the FORM_FIELDS YAML block, placeholder
  syntax, and conditional syntax all match.

  Two agents only: QA (test owner) and Coder (implementer). Hard separation
  of duties, hard iteration caps, hard out-of-scope guardrails.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RENDERER CONTRACT
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Read the FORM_FIELDS YAML block — declares every form field with type,
     label, default, and conditional visibility ("show_if").
  2. Render a form (or interview the user via AskUserQuestion). Apply
     defaults. Hide fields whose `show_if` evaluates false.
  3. On submit, substitute every {{FIELD_NAME}} with the user's value, and
     resolve every {{#if FIELD == "value"}} ... {{/if}} block.
  4. Strip this comment block AND the FORM_FIELDS YAML block before
     presenting the rendered prompt to the user for review.
================================================================================

FORM_FIELDS:
  - name: worktree_action
    type: radio
    label: Worktree
    options: [reuse-current, create-new]
    default: reuse-current
    help: reuse-current = run the loop inside the worktree you're already in. create-new = spawn a fresh worktree first. The /stx-fix skill auto-selects create-new when the user is on main.

  - name: worktree_name
    type: text
    label: New worktree name (only when creating)
    show_if: worktree_action == "create-new"
    placeholder: e.g. bugfix_subs_cancel
    help: Used as both the worktree directory and the branch suffix (bugfix/<name>).

  - name: title
    type: text
    label: Short title for this fix
    placeholder: e.g. Fix Pro Monthly active state on /subscribe
    help: One line. Becomes the PR title and the working label across agents.

  - name: issues
    type: textarea
    label: Issue list (numbered)
    placeholder: |
      1. <symptom>: <what user sees>
      2. <symptom>: <what user sees>
    help: One numbered item per distinct bug. Symptoms only — no causes, no fixes.

  - name: repro
    type: textarea
    label: How to reproduce
    placeholder: |
      - URL: <e.g. http://localhost:3002/subscribe>
      - User / state: <e.g. logged in as ssen@socitix.com, billing_status=active>
      - Steps: 1. ... 2. ... 3. ...
    help: Concrete steps an agent can replay. Include the user account, URL, and any DB state precondition.

  - name: expected
    type: textarea
    label: Expected behavior (acceptance criteria)
    placeholder: |
      1. <what should happen instead for issue 1>
      2. <what should happen instead for issue 2>
    help: Mirror the issue list one-to-one. This is the acceptance criteria QA's tests must encode.

  - name: scope_hints
    type: textarea
    label: Suspected files / scope hints (optional)
    placeholder: |
      - components/SubscribeCard.tsx
      - hooks/useEntitlements.ts
    help: Files you suspect, or "unknown — investigate." Keeps the Coder from drifting into unrelated areas.

  - name: out_of_scope
    type: textarea
    label: Out of scope (optional)
    placeholder: |
      - Don't refactor the unrelated /pricing page
      - Don't change Stripe price IDs
    help: Hard guardrails. Anything listed here is off-limits even if the Coder thinks it would help.

  - name: test_kind
    type: radio
    label: Test kind
    options: [playwright, vitest-unit, both]
    default: playwright
    help: playwright = browser-driven E2E. vitest-unit = unit/contract test against the affected service or hook. both = unit test for the service + Playwright for the UI surface.

  - name: use_browser_mcp
    type: checkbox
    label: Allow Coder to verify visually with Chrome Dev / Playwright MCP?
    default: true
    help: On for UI-visible bugs (visual states, modals, copy). Off for backend-only or pure-logic fixes — avoids the agent screen-poking instead of fixing.

  - name: iteration_cap
    type: number
    label: Max iterations before halting
    default: 5
    help: Hard ceiling for the QA → Fix → QA loop. Halt at 3 if the *same surface bug* keeps recurring (systemic miss). 5 is the absolute ceiling across all symptoms.

  - name: commit_policy
    type: radio
    label: Commit policy
    options: [no-commit, commit-after-green, commit-and-pr]
    default: commit-after-green
    help: no-commit = leave changes uncommitted. commit-after-green = commit once all tests pass; user opens PR. commit-and-pr = commit + push + open PR after green (still requires user-issued instruction; this just declares intent up front).

# Fix issues with multi-agent loop: {{title}}

{{#if worktree_action == "create-new"}}
## 0. Setup

A new worktree was created for this fix:

- Worktree path: `.claude/worktrees/{{worktree_name}}`
- Branch: `bugfix/{{worktree_name}}`
- `.env.local` has been symlinked from the main worktree if applicable.

All work below happens **inside that worktree**.
{{/if}}

## 1. The issues

{{issues}}

## 2. Reproduction

{{repro}}

## 3. Expected behavior (acceptance criteria)

{{expected}}

## 4. Scope

**Suspected files / hints:**

{{scope_hints}}

**Out of scope (do NOT touch):**

{{out_of_scope}}

## 5. Agent roles and contracts

The orchestrator (the main assistant running this prompt) is the **router and judge**. It spawns the two sub-agents below, routes results between them, and decides when to halt. The orchestrator does NOT write production code itself; that's the Coder's job. The orchestrator does NOT write tests itself; that's QA's job.

The full contracts for both agents live in versioned persona files. **Load them by reference** — do not embed contract text inline.

### Agent A — QA (test owner)

**Persona file:** `.claude/agents/stx-qa.md` (shared with `/stx-feature`).

**At spawn time:** paste the entire contents of `.claude/agents/stx-qa.md` into the QA agent's prompt verbatim, then append the following task-specific context:

> **Test kind for this run:** `{{test_kind}}`. Cover **every numbered issue** in §1 of this rendered prompt, asserting the expected behavior in §3. Use the **Authoring contract (stx-fix)** section of your persona file. After the Coder reports green, follow the **Verification contract (the loop)** section.

If `.claude/agents/stx-qa.md` cannot be read, **halt the loop** — do not fall back to an inline contract.

### Agent B — Coder (implementer)

**Persona file:** `.claude/agents/stx-coder.md`.

**At spawn time:** paste the entire contents of `.claude/agents/stx-coder.md` into the Coder agent's prompt verbatim, then append:

> **Failing test(s):** `<paths handed off by QA>`. **Suspected files (§4 scope hints):** `{{scope_hints}}`. **Out-of-scope (§4):** `{{out_of_scope}}`. Implement the smallest change that turns the failing test(s) green.

{{#if use_browser_mcp == true}}
Additionally, for UI-visible changes, append:

> Use the Chrome Dev / Playwright MCP after your change: navigate to the repro URL in §2, drive the flow, confirm the symptom is gone. Include browser verification notes in your hand-back report.
{{/if}}

If `.claude/agents/stx-coder.md` cannot be read, **halt the loop** — do not fall back to an inline contract.

### Where to read the full contracts

- **QA contract**, including authoring rules, verification rules, pause authority, and hard rules: `.claude/agents/stx-qa.md`.
- **Coder contract**, including hard rules (no test edits, no weakened assertions, no out-of-scope edits), writing style, and hand-back report shape: `.claude/agents/stx-coder.md`.

Both files ship with the stx-skills package and are copied into the consuming project by the installer.

## 6. The loop

```
QA writes failing test(s)
   ↓
QA confirms tests fail for the right reason
   ↓
Coder implements minimal fix
   ↓
Coder runs tests + lint + build {{#if use_browser_mcp == true}}+ browser check{{/if}}
   ↓
QA reruns tests independently
   ├─ all green → §7 (done criteria)
   └─ any red → back to Coder with the specific failure
```

**Iteration caps:**
- **Soft cap — 3 cycles on the same surface bug:** if the same symptom recurs across 3 Coder attempts, the loop is converging on the wrong abstraction. **Halt and escalate to the user** with the failure package below.
- **Hard cap — {{iteration_cap}} total cycles:** absolute ceiling regardless of which symptom. **Halt and escalate.**

When a cap trips, the orchestrator does NOT keep trying. Instead:

1. Stash uncommitted changes, OR commit them on a WIP branch named `wip/<title-slug>` (clearly marked as not-for-merge).
2. Write a handoff doc to `docs/tasks/<title-slug>-handoff.md` containing:
   - The failing test(s) and current failure output.
   - Each Coder attempt: what was changed, why it didn't work.
   - Working hypothesis on why the loop stalled (wrong layer? hidden coupling? bad test?).
   - Suggested next move(s) for a human.
3. Surface the cap to the user with a one-paragraph summary and a pointer to the handoff doc.

## 7. Done criteria

All of these must be true before the loop ends:

- [ ] Every issue in §1 has at least one test in QA's file that asserts the expected behavior in §3.
- [ ] QA confirms tests are green on a fresh independent run (not just Coder's run).
- [ ] `npm run lint` is clean.
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds.
- [ ] No test was deleted, skipped, or had its assertions weakened during the loop.
- [ ] Out-of-scope guardrails in §4 were respected.
{{#if use_browser_mcp == true}}
- [ ] Coder visually confirmed each issue's fix in the browser.
{{/if}}

## 8. After green

{{#if commit_policy == "no-commit"}}
**Commit policy: no-commit.** Leave the changes uncommitted. Summarize what changed and where, then wait for the user's commit instruction.
{{/if}}
{{#if commit_policy == "commit-after-green"}}
**Commit policy: commit-after-green.** Once §7 is satisfied, ask the user explicitly:

> "All tests green. Commit and push to `bugfix/<branch>`?"

Wait for "yes" / "commit" / equivalent before running `git commit`. A single user "yes" covers commit + push, not opening a PR — that's a separate step.
{{/if}}
{{#if commit_policy == "commit-and-pr"}}
**Commit policy: commit-and-pr.** Once §7 is satisfied, ask the user explicitly:

> "All tests green. Commit, push, and open PR?"

Treat that single "yes" as approval for the full chain (per global multi-step approval rule). Halt and report on any failure mid-chain.
{{/if}}

## 9. Reporting back to the user

When the loop ends (green OR halted at cap), the orchestrator's final message includes:

1. **Status:** green / halted at cap / blocked
2. **Per-issue table:** issue # → test status → fix file(s) → 1-line of what changed
3. **Iterations used:** N / {{iteration_cap}}
4. **Notable:** unexpected refactors avoided, related-but-out-of-scope bugs surfaced, test coverage gaps exposed.
5. **Next action awaiting user:** commit? PR? deploy test? merge?

Keep it short — bullets, not paragraphs. The diff and test output speak for themselves.
